Module: Web Vulnerability Scanner

Description:
This module is responsible for analyzing open ports discovered during the 
port scanning phase. Its main objectives are:

  1. Detecting active web servers (HTTP/HTTPS) on the target system.
  2. Identifying and flagging ports commonly associated with malicious activity.

The results from this module provide valuable insights into potential 
security risks related to exposed services.
